# Study Buddy Documentation

This folder contains the core planning documents for the Study Buddy project.

## Documents

- `srs.md` → Software Requirements Specification
- `schema.md` → Database Schema Design (Supabase Postgres)
- `roadmap.md` → MVP development phases and build order
- `user-flows.md` → User journeys and feature flows

These docs define the product scope and prevent feature drift during development.
