Study Buddy Project Workflow (Step-by-Step)

This is the full professional development flow, but in a simple builder-friendly way.

PHASE 0: Product Foundation (Before Any Code)
Step 1: Lock the Core Idea

Write the one-liner:

Study Buddy is an aesthetic study planner app with built-in scheduling, Pomodoro focus, DSA tracking, and motivation.

Do not expand scope yet.

Step 2: Define the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Your MVP should include only:

Login/signup

Dashboard

Weekly planner

Pomodoro timer

Striver sheet tracker

Quotes + streak

Not Google Calendar yet (Phase 2).

Step 3: Write the Core Documents (Done Already)

You need these stored in /docs:

SRS (requirements)

Schema design doc

Feature list + MVP scope

Roadmap phases

This prevents random building.

PHASE 1: System Design + Architecture
Step 4: Decide the Stack (Final)

Frontend: Next.js
Auth: Clerk
Database: Supabase Postgres
Backend: Node/Next API routes
Deployment: Vercel

Step 5: Plan the App Modules

Break Study Buddy into clear modules:

Auth Module

Dashboard Module

Weekly Planner Module

Pomodoro Module

DSA Tracker Module

Motivation Module

Calendar Integration Module (later)

This is your folder structure base.

Step 6: Finalize Database Schema

Create tables first:

users

study_tasks

pomodoro_sessions

dsa_questions

dsa_progress

quotes

Supabase should be ready before UI.

PHASE 2: Project Setup
Step 7: Initialize the Next.js Project

Create repo + base project.

Set up:

TailwindCSS

shadcn/ui

Basic routing

No features yet.

Step 8: Connect Clerk Authentication

Do auth early because everything depends on users.

Milestone:

User can sign up

User lands on dashboard after login

Step 9: Connect Supabase Database

Set up:

Supabase project

Tables created

Clerk user ID stored in users

Milestone:

Each logged-in user has DB entry

PHASE 3: Build MVP Features in Correct Order
Step 10: Build Dashboard Skeleton

Dashboard should show placeholders:

Weekly plan section

Pomodoro section

DSA tracker section

Quote section

No logic yet.

Step 11: Weekly Planner Feature (Core)

Implement:

User selects weekly goal

App generates tasks for Mon–Fri

Tasks stored in study_tasks

Milestone:

Weekly plan appears on dashboard

Step 12: Pomodoro Timer Feature

Build timer with:

Start/pause/reset

Save completed sessions to DB

Milestone:

Focus sessions tracked per user

Step 13: Quotes + Motivation Feature

Add:

Quote of the day

Streak counter

Milestone:

App feels alive, not robotic

Step 14: Striver Sheet Tracker

Workflow:

Seed dsa_questions once

User checks questions off

Progress stored in dsa_progress

Milestone:

User can track DSA properly

PHASE 4: Polish the Aesthetic Planner Experience
Step 15: UI Styling + Theme System

Add:

Pastel themes

Rounded planner cards

Cute minimal animations

Milestone:

Study Buddy feels aesthetic, not like an admin panel

Step 16: Progress Summaries

Add weekly view:

Tasks completed

Pomodoro minutes

Questions solved

Milestone:

User sees growth

PHASE 5: Phase 2 Features (After MVP Works)
Step 17: Google Calendar Integration

Only after planner works.

Add:

Connect Google OAuth

Sync study blocks

Avoid overwriting user events

Milestone:

Calendar becomes a bonus, not a dependency

Step 18: Revision Automation

Add spaced repetition:

Completed question → revision due in 3 days

Auto-create revision tasks

Milestone:

App becomes smarter than a checklist

PHASE 6: Deployment + Launch
Step 19: Deploy MVP

Deploy stack:

Vercel frontend

Supabase DB

Clerk auth live

Milestone:

App usable by real users

Step 20: Testing + Feedback

Test with 5–10 students:

Is planner helpful?

Is UI calming?

Does tracking feel easy?

Fix pain points.

Step 21: Public Launch

Launch on:

Product Hunt

Twitter

College communities

Recommended Timeline (Realistic)

Week 1: Docs + Auth + DB
Week 2: Planner + Dashboard
Week 3: Pomodoro + DSA Tracker
Week 4: UI polish + Deployment
Week 5: Calendar integration
